⛔ DEPRECATED. This example demonstrates how to integrate the [End-User Report Designer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/asp-net-webforms-reporting/end-user-report-designer?v=18.2) into a [DevExtreme](https://js.devexpress.com//)-based Single Page Application project.
Starting with v18.1, the DevExtreme hybrid mobile-related tools and the demonstrated integration approach are deprecated.
